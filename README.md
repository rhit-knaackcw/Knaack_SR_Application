# Curtis Knaack's Sports Reference Application:
 
The main.py file in this repository contains my solution
to the engineering internship prompt. 
I made the following assumptions while coding: The json file being 
read would keep the teams in the exact same order relative to each 
other and only excluding themselves from the array of Win-Loss data and 
the Win-Loss data was consistent across teams (example: if 'BRO' is 8-12 
against 'CHC', then 'CHC' is 12-8 against 'BRO'). 
Thank you for your consideration for this position. If you have any 
questions about my code or any other part of my application please do not 
hesitate to email me at:
